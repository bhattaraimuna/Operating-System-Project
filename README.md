# Operating-System-Project
This repository consists of following files-
1. malloc.c - Using C, this file creates a separate malloc library in the system.
2. shell.c - Using C, this file creates a separate shell terminal in the system.
3. filesystem.c - In this code, users will have the ability to create the filesystem image, list the files currently in the file system, add files, remove files, and save the filesystem. Files will persist in the file system image when the program exits.
